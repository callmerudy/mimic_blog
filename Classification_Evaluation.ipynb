Classification can be understood as two distict tasks: creating clusters within an existing set of data, or 'unsupervised learning'; or classifiying new data into an already understood class, or 'supervised learning'.  Our goal is the latter, as we want to be able to predict whether a given patient (with a given index admission) should be considered as 'a likley readmitter' or not. \n",
