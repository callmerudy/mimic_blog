## Predicting 30 Day Readmission from the MIMIC-III Dataset

This project works to predict 30-day urgent and emergency care readmissions from hospital discharges. I'm using [MIMIC-III](mimic.physionet.org), an open-source, anonymized dataset that contains records for more than 40,000 patients who were treated over a period of ten years.

You can take a look at the project code here - [MIMIC Project Code](https://github.com/mattlewissf/mimic)

Here's a report of the project with results (updated 5/2) - [MIMIC Project Report](https://github.com/mattlewissf/mimic_blog/blob/master/0%20-%20Project%20Report.ipynb)

And here's a Table of Contents for our deeper dive discussions into how I built this model model. Some of these pages will change over time.
